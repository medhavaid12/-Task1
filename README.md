# -Task1
This is featuring my tasks for the internship with CodSoft.

So I have completed the Task1 for my internship of CodSoft which features my personal portfolio.
This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It showcases my skills, projects, education, and contact information in a clean and interactive format. 
The website includes smooth navigation, section-wise animations, and a user-friendly layout designed to make a strong first impression on visitors and potential employers.
